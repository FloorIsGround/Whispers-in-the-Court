"""Court Brain as a single program: WhispersInTheCourt.exe.

The player downloads one file and starts it, as with other mod launchers.
Inside it (built by tools/build_exe.py with PyInstaller) are Python, Court
Brain and the mod itself. At every start the program:

- installs the mod into EU5's mod folder, or updates it when the copy there
  differs from the one it carries (a fingerprint of the files is kept next
  to the installed mod, in .votc_bundle). It installs its own copy even when
  the player also subscribed on the Steam Workshop: only this copy carries
  what depends on the player's game (the hidden debug boxes), so it is named
  "Whispers in the Court (USE THIS)" in the launcher;
- keeps its settings in %LOCALAPPDATA%\\WhispersInTheCourt\\config.json (the
  folder of a downloaded exe may not be writable);
- can start EU5 through Steam with -debug_mode, which the bridge needs.

Run from the sources (python -m courtbrain) everything works the same, with
the mod taken from the repository and config.json beside the package.
